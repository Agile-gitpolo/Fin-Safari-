With no major news catalysts and price consolidating around $214, risk/reward appears balanced; maintain HOLD until clearer direction emerges.",

Price is consolidating near $315–$325 after last week’s swing high of $336.20; analysts’ median target $331.67 implies limited upside. News flow is light ahead of 22 Oct earnings, and options activity shows balanced open-interest. Social sentiment is mixed—bullish on FSD progress, cautious on macro. Maintain HOLD until a clear breakout above $325 or breakdown below $305.",
