      "description": "ROKU closed Friday at $93.29, up 2.4% on the week but still well off its February highs. Q1 showed narrowing losses (-$27M vs ‑$51M YoY) and positive FCF, though ARPU is no longer disclosed. Valuation compressed to 2.1× sales, pricing it like a value stock. Street expects Q2 results on 7/31; Benchmark reiterated Buy ahead of print. Social sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but options flow shows elevated put activity. Hold pending earnings clarity.",

News flow is light, and social sentiment is mixed. With earnings still ~5 weeks away and implied volatility subdued (IV30 rank 13%), the stock appears range-bound between $80–$82.",
