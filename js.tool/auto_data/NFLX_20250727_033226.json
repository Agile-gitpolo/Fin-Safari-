    "description": "NFLX closed at $1,180.49, down only ‑0.02% after a choppy week. Q2 revenue beat ($11.12B, +13.7% y/y) and EPS surge (+47%) are offset by mixed analyst moves: two downgrades (Phillip to Sell, price-target-cut to $950) vs. multiple PT hikes to $1,400-$1,500 range. Technicals sit neutral—price is 1% below 10-DMA and 7% off the $1,341 high, while volume (2.6 M) is below the 4 M average. Options flow is light, and social sentiment is mildly positive on ad-tier growth but cautious on competition. Fair value models flag a 212% premium to Morningstar’s $828 FV. Risk/reward looks balanced near-term.",
