    "description": "BABA closed at $120.03 (-1.0% intraday) after hitting a 2.5-month low earlier in the week. The stock is under pressure from a $1.53 B bond-issue announcement and renewed tariff fears, forming a bearish A-B-C pattern with next support around $100.55. Long-term fundamentals remain solid (14× P/E, buybacks, AI/cloud focus), but technicals flash “Sell” and options flow is defensive. Expect choppy trading between $96–$126 until macro clarity improves.",
