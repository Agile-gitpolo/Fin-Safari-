    "description": "PINS opened at 36.46 and is trading up 2.9 % to 37.11 on 10.8 M shares—well above the 90-day average—after a strong pre-market pop to 38.84. Technical trend is now “Uptrend” with price above key moving averages. Implied volatility remains elevated (60 % IV30, 70 % rank) ahead of the 7-Aug earnings release, but option flow is skewed bullish. No material negative news; only routine insider selling. Momentum and sentiment favor continued strength into earnings.",
