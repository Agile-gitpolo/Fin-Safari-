    "description": "NVDA closed at $173.50 (-0.14%) after hitting an intraday high of $174.72. Short-term technical signals remain positive despite the minor pullback; volume contracted to 122 M shares, which is often constructive after a run-up. 43/48 analysts rate it a Buy with an average 12-month target of $181.27. AI demand narrative intact, but insiders have been net sellers and the stock is near resistance, so risk/reward is less favorable for intraday traders.",
