    "description": "ROKU closed Friday at $93.29, up 2.4% on the week but still well off its February highs. Q1 showed narrowing losses (-$27M vs ‑$51M YoY) and positive FCF, though ARPU is no longer disclosed. Valuation compressed to 2.1× sales, pricing it like a value stock. Street expects Q2 results on 7/31; Benchmark reiterated Buy ahead of print. Social sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but options flow shows elevated put activity. Hold pending earnings clarity.",
