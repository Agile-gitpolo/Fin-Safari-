    "description": "AMZN closed Friday at $231.44 (-0.34% on the day, +23.3% over 3 months). Volume cooled to 28.7 M vs 42.9 M Thursday. Mixed signals: technical score downgraded from Strong Buy to Buy, Jeff Bezos filed large insider sells (≈$3.5 B this week), and Canada’s Competition Bureau opened a pricing-policy probe. Earnings due 31 Jul (consensus EPS $1.33 vs $1.23 YoY). RSI ~41 suggests neither oversold nor overbought; price sits just above 50-day SMA ($214.95). Wait for post-earnings guidance before adding.",
