    "description": "Adobe Inc. is trading flat at $366.22 (+0.1%). Price sits below both 50-day ($393) and 200-day ($431) MAs, indicating a technical downtrend, yet RSI at 51.9 shows neutral momentum. 27 buy vs 2 sell ratings from analysts imply upside to avg target $483 (+29.8%). Recent AI-product buzz and strong FCF ($8.3 B) support sentiment, but low volume (1.2 M vs 3.9 M avg) keeps risk elevated.",
