    "description": "CRM closed at $267.70, down just â€‘0.04% intraday but off 23.7% YTD. Mixed signals: strong Q1 earnings beat, 96% upside in analyst PT ($440 max), yet technicals remain neutral-to-sell and social chatter is cautious ahead of the Aug-20 earnings call. Volume at 5.9 M is above the 30-day average, suggesting active repositioning.",
