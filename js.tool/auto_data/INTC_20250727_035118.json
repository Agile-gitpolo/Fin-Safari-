    "description": "INTC plunged 9.4% Friday after mixed Q2 results and a strategic pivot that scales back foundry expansion, overshadowing a top-line beat. CEO Lip-Bu Tan scrapped German/Polish plants and slowed Ohio construction, spooking investors about Intel’s manufacturing roadmap. Volume spiked to 244 M shares—triple the norm—while technicals flipped bearish with 26 of 26 indicators flashing SELL. Social sentiment is very negative, though insiders have been net buyers. Near-term pain likely; wait for support test around $20.",
