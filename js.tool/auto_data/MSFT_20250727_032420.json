    "description": "MSFT closed Friday at $498.84, up 1.6 % for the week and hovering just below its all-time high of $514.64 set on 18 Jul. Volume has been above-average (≈14 M shares) ahead of Wednesday’s FQ4 earnings (consensus EPS $3.35 vs $2.95 YoY). News flow is light—main items are a patched SharePoint hijack (no price impact) and continued AI-cap-ex momentum. Social sentiment is mildly positive, but implied volatility is compressed, suggesting a wait-and-see stance into the print.",
