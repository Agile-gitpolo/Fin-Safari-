    "description": "Snap closed at $9.11, down 2.4% intraday. Recent upgrades (Bernstein & Morgan Stanley raising PT to $10 and $8.50) and heavy options flow (≈200 k contracts Friday) hint at cautious optimism ahead of the 7/31 earnings. However, YTD ‑19% and bearish technical backdrop (price below 50- & 200-day SMA) keep risk/reward balanced.",
