    "description": "AAPL closed at $213.88, up 0.06% on the day. Price is wedged between narrow resistance at $216.5 and support at $202.94; mixed technical signals (RSI 57, MACD bullish crossover but still below 200-day SMA). Earnings due 31 Jul (consensus EPS $1.42) is the next catalyst. Legal overhang from multiple securities-fraud suits and AI-strategy pressure are capping upside, while $500 M rare-earth investment offers a modest tail-wind. Volume at 40.3 M is slightly below 3-month average, indicating wait-and-see sentiment.",
