    "description": "META closed Friday at $712.68 (-0.30% on the day, ‑1.7% WoW). Volume fell to 8.2 M shares vs 10.9 M Thursday, indicating waning momentum. Technicals are mixed: price sits just above the 50-day SMA ($689) but below the 21-day ($717) and faces resistance at $726. Earnings due Wednesday (cons. EPS $5.80) could catalyze a ±3.5% move. News sentiment is cautiously bullish, with AI product roll-outs and ad-revenue optimism offset by regulatory headlines. Social chatter is net positive but fear-greed index at 39 (Fear) keeps retail cautious. Maintain HOLD into earnings.",
